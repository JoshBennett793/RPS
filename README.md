# Rock Paper Scissors

  This Rock Paper Scissors project, as part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum, will showcase
what I have learned of JavaScript so far. It will start without a graphical interface and will
be played from the console and a graphical interface will be added as a later step in the TOP
curriculum.

  I went into this project thinking it would be fairly easy, but was quickly humbled. I 
recieved help from members of the TOP discord community, learned a great deal, and that really 
helped cement some of the concepts of Javascript taught so far. 

  I utilized a for loop to implement a 5 round function that iterates through a single round function. 
I implemented multiple functions and conditional statements to allow for the prompting of the user
to input a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. I ensured that if the user does not choose a valid 
option, it will decrement the iteration to allow the user to play all 5 rounds successfully. I also 
implemented a function that displays the winner at the end of the 5th round based on who's score is
higher and if the scores match each other, it will display the result of the game as a tie. The score
of each round, computer's choice, and round result are displayed in the console after each round.
